                    Geralt of Rivia (Polish: Geralt z Rivii) is a fictional character and the protagonist of The Witcher series of short stories and novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. He is a magically enhanced monster-hunter known as a "witcher", who possesses supernatural abilities due to his mutations. He was described by Péter Apor as a character embodying "the neo-liberal anti-politics" spirit of the Polish popular culture of the 1990s, following his debut in the books.[1]

Geralt of Rivia is also the protagonist in CD Projekt Red's series of video games based on The Witcher. In television adaptations, he is portrayed by Michał Żebrowski in The Hexer film and TV series, while Henry Cavill portrays the character in Netflix's The Witcher TV series.[2][3]

                    Sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg (nicknamed Yen or Yenna) first appeared in the collection of short stories, The Last Wish, featuring in both "The Last Wish" short story and "The Voice of Reason" frame story. She went on to appear in numerous other Witcher stories and is one of the main characters of the Witcher saga.[3]

Yennefer is described as possessive. She becomes one of Geralt's lovers although their relationship is difficult and full of drama. Both Geralt and Yennefer are sterile, which adds another level of tragedy to the mix. Yennefer has a hard time accepting the fact and tries various methods of restoring her fertility. Yennefer ends up becoming a mother to Ciri while teaching her and watching over her while she was at Ellander.
